# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Nov 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Learned a cleaner way to toggle a boolean state with the NOT operator. (ex `!this.state.visible`)
- Learned an even better way to handle conditional rendering by using the AND operator. (ex `{condition && <h1>Hello world!</h1>}`)
- Learn to use multi-leveled ternary operators to handle logic within JSX.
- Rendered conditionally from props.
- Conditional styling with state.
- Dynamically render elements with `Array.map()`.
- Using map to give items a unique key.
- Combine `Array.filter()` and `Array.map()` to filter and render elements based on a condition.
- Render components on the server using `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()`.
- Worked on side project scoreboard.

**Thoughts**:

Learned a lot about conditional rendering and using built in array functions to handle rendering. Nothing seemed to unclear. Going through all these lessons actually cleared up a lot of what I was confused on such as using the `&&` operator and when to use `renderToString()`.
